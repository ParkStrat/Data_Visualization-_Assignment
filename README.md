# Data_Visualization_Assignment
### Using Python to create a visually appealing, informative visualization

**Task:** Use a publicly available data set of my choosing to create a visually appealing and informative graphical representation from the data set. 

**Purpose:** Gain more experience with and understanding of Python, Matploylib, and Seaborn for the data visualization.


**The Data:** The data I used was originally sourced from the World Bank, but it publicly available through data.world. This data set aggregates information on a variety of factors that may contribute to overall life satisfaction or happiness.


**The Visualization:** I used the data to assess if there was a general geographic trend in life satisfaction or in other words, if certain areas of the world where "happier" than others. The chart below demonstrates that there are clearly regional differences in life satisfaction. However, this is likely simple correlation with no causation.
